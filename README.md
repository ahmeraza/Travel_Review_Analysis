# Decoding-Income-Disparities
This project analyzes the ratings on destinations in 10 categories of the data on TripAdvisor.com

## Description

The project analyzes traveler ratings for destinations across East Asia capturing 10 features. 
Each rating is classified into five levels: Excellent (4), Very Good (3), Average (2), Poor (1), 
and Terrible (0), making it ideal for classification and clustering tasks. Given its multivariate and 
textual nature, the dataset can be analyzed to uncover patterns in user preferences, determine the 
most and least rated categories, and apply clustering techniques to segment travelers based on their 
review behaviors. Additionally, sentiment analysis can be performed to assess traveler satisfaction trends, 
while machine learning models can be trained to predict user ratings based on previous reviews. 

The dataset is clean, with no missing values, making it well-suited for advanced analytical approaches 
in tourism analytics, recommendation systems, and market segmentation.
